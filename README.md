# WIP - Warning

This WIP does not work. It strives for encapsulating all the routing stuff into
a container which later on as a privileged one is able to establish required
routing infrastructure in terms of routing tables, iptables rules, etc. pp.

Reason for these efforts is to make this portable across different platforms -
even for those which do not have Linux as an explicit host system (see docker
for mac).

Changes:

* Create `docker-compose.yml`
* Put `run.sh` as `routing.sh` into some kind of initialization container
* Due to this change we needed a way to detect the ip address of the actual
  squid container. Added a lean webserver and a shell script which provides the
  container ip address via HTTP. Docker4Mac does not use the docker builtin
  networking insofar, that `docker inspect <sha>` does not return the proper
  address allocated for the squid container.
* Extend original behaviour to setups which using their own bridging device
* Make effective docker image way smaller by condensing the build into a single
  layer which prior of writing cleans up all the temporary build dependencies


# docker-proxy

Transparent caching proxy server for Docker containers, run in a Docker
container. It can speed up the dependency-fetching part of your application
build process.

## Instructions for Use

First check out the code. Then build with:

```
sudo docker build -t docker-proxy .
```

Then run with:

```
./run.sh
```

The script will start the container and set up the appropriate
routing rules. Your other Docker containers will automatically use
the proxy, whether or not they were already running. When you are finished,
just press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>C</kbd> to stop the proxy.

NOTE: This project is _not_ designed to be run with a simple `docker run` - it
requires `run.sh` to be run on the docker host, so it can adjust the
routing rules. You will need to check this code out
and run `run.sh` on the host. For OS X, that's on your [boot2docker],
Docker Machine or similar host). To start under [Docker Machine] on OS X:

```
docker-machine scp run.sh default:/home/docker/run.sh
docker-machine ssh default
sh ./run.sh
```

[Docker Machine]: https://docs.docker.com/machine/get-started/

## Overview

`run.sh` will fire up a Docker container running Squid, with
appropriate firewall rules in place for transparent proxying. It will also
configure port-based routing on the main host such that any traffic from a
Docker container to port 80 routes via the transparent proxy container. It
requires `sudo` access to perform the firewall changes, and it will prompt you
for your password as appropriate.

`run.sh` is designed to run in the foreground, because when the
container terminates it needs to remove the rules that were redirecting the
traffic.

If you want to see Squid in operation, you can (in another terminal) attach
to the `docker-proxy` container - it is tailing the access log, so will show a
record of requests made.

## HTTPS Support

The proxy server supports HTTPS caching via Squid's [SSL Bump] feature. To
enable it, start with:

```
./run.sh ssl
```

The server will decrypt traffic from the server and encrypt it again using its
own root certificate. HTTPS connections from your other Docker containers will
fail until you install the root certificate. To install it:

 1. Install the `ca-certificates` package (Debian/Ubuntu images)
 2. Run [`detect-proxy.sh`]

Those steps can be performed in a running container (for testing), or you can
add them to your `Dockerfile`. `detect-proxy.sh` can be run after you install
your OS packages with apt, because apt shouldn't need HTTPS. However, adding
PPAs with `add-apt-repository` will fail until the certificate is installed. See
[`test/Dockerfile`] for an example.

Some programs don't use the OS's primary key store, such as `npm` and `pip`.
You may need to take extra steps for those programs.

To test HTTPS support, do this in another console after starting the proxy:

```
cd test
sudo docker build -t test-proxy .
sudo docker run --rm test-proxy
# Should print "All tests passed"
```

## Notes

This proxy configuration is intended to be used solely to speed
up development of Docker applications. **Do not** attempt to use this to
eavesdrop on other people's connections.

There exists a real possibility this script will break your `iptables` or `ip`
rules in some unexpected way. Be aware that if things go wrong, the potential
exists for all containers to lose the ability to download anything.
